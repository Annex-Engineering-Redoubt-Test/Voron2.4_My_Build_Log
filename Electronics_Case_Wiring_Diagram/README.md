# Electronics Case Wiring Diagram for QUEEN (my Voron 2.4 build):

This repository contains JPG and PDF files for the electronics case for QUEEN.  I am presently working on the "Fuctional Wiring Diagram" for my QUEEN Build.  I am concurrently working on the "Real World" Electronics Case Diagram which will
show you the actual routing of all the wires I will use for my QUEEN Build.

I have spent the last two months, creating a 3D model for my QUEEN Voron 2.4 250mmÂ³ build.  All the parts in this 3D model use parametric bodies for the 3D printd parts.  I even added 3D models of the electroncis boards and PSUs.

I will be publishing a folder of .stl files for all the printed parts I am using for my QUEEN build, including the ones from my PIF parts (comming soon).

I will also be publishing the 3D model of my QUEEN printer.

You will also be able to find my Sourcing Guide for QUEEN (comming soon).

### The PDF file of the Bottom "Electronics Case Wiring Diagram" for QUEEN:

Coming Soon.

<!--- The PDF file looks the same as the JPG file. You can enlarge the image for both file types to get all the details.

You can view the PDF in your browser by clicking on the filename ["Voron_2.4_Tool_Head_PCB__Wiring_Harness.pdf"](https://github.com/GadgetAngel/Voron2.4_My_Build_Log/blob/main/Voron2.4_My_Build_Log/Wiring_Harness_Diagram/Voron_2.4_Tool_Head_PCB__Wiring_Harness.pdf) and then hit the download button.

You can view an even higher resolution image when you view the PDF in your browser by clicking on the filename ["Voron_2.4_Tool_Head_PCB__Wiring_Harness_400ppi.pdf"](https://github.com/GadgetAngel/Voron2.4_My_Build_Log/blob/main/Voron2.4_My_Build_Log/Wiring_Harness_Diagram/Voron_2.4_Tool_Head_PCB__Wiring_Harness_400ppi.pdf) and then hit the download button. -->

Coming Soon.

I intend to use snapshots from the 3D model I developed for the QUEEN printer, showing you the acutal route I
will use for each wire.
