# Electronics Case Wiring Diagram for QUEEN (my Voron 2.4 build):

This repository contains JPG and PDF files for the electronics case for QUEEN.  I am presently working on the "Fuctional Wiring Diagram" for my QUEEN Build.  I am concurrently working on the "Real World" Electronics case Diagram which will
show you the actual wire routing I will use for my QUEEN Build.

I have spent the last two months, creating a 3D model for my QUEEN Voron 2.4 250mm³ build.  All the parts in this 3D model use parametric bodies for the 3D printd parts.  I even added 3D models of the Electroncis boards and PSU.

I will be publishing a folder of .stl files for all the printed parts I used for my QUEEN build, including the once from
my PIF parts (comming soon)

I will also be publishing the 3D model of my QUEEN printer.

You will also be able to find my Sourcing Guide for QUEEN. (comming soon)

### What is the Litter Box Mod?

Think of the "Litter Box" as the poor man's DOOM mod.  Basically, I split the electronics up into two sections. AC electronics go in the "bottom case" on the Voron 2.5 250mm³ and the standard electronics boards go in the "Litter Box" mod.  Instead of putting the "standard electronics" on the TOP of the printer (as the DOOM MOD does),  I put the boards on the BACK of the Voron 2.5 250mm³ build.  I did this so I would **not** have to buy another wiring harness. I can use the wiring harnesses that are pre-made.  For the DOOM Mod the pre-made wiring harness will not work because it will not be long enough, but the "Litter Box" mod allows you to use the pre-made wiring harness.   I also designed the "Litter Box" mod so that one can not tell the "Litter Box" mod is attached to the printer unless you are viewing the Voron from the side.

Another requirement was that I did not have to cut out a lot of different holes in the Top/Bottom panel or the Side panels.  I also designed an "Extended" skirt, so that the back skirt is not hidden underneath the mod, instead the back skirt has been moved out.

## A Picture of the "Litter Box" mod for QUEEN:

The "Litter Box" mod is a place to store all you good shit......LOL

The name is a wink to RCF (a.k.a RussianCatFood).

I also have posted two videos which give you a roatating view of the QUEEN 3D model.  This is the 3D model I used
to devleop the Litter Box.

1. First look Video: https://youtu.be/x5X1lYImGgg;

2. Second Look Video: https://youtu.be/KOevvhMHMqQ

Here are some still pictures:

The Front View:

!["Front View of QUEEN"](.../images/Front.png)

 The Litter Box can not be seen, the Voron 2.4 looks actually like a regular Voron 2.4 machine.

The Left Profile View:

!["Left Profile View"](.../images/Left_profile.png)

This is where you see the Litter Box mod.  The Litter Box mod will hang off the back and over the Back Panel of the Voron 2.4 printer. There is no need to buy another Back Panel since the Litter Box Mod is designed to hold the Back Panel in place instead of the Panel Clips.

The Wide Right View:

The Bottom View with panels:

 ## A Picture of the "Litter Box" "Electronics Case Wiring Diagram" for QUEEN:

Coming Soon.

I intend to use snapshots from the 3D model I developed for the QUEEN printer, showing you the acutal route I
will use for each wire.
