## Sourcing Guide for my Voron 2.4 QUEEN build

As a starting point for this Sourcing Guide, I based my Sourcing Guide on @shammy#6484 Sourcing Guide.  I want to thank @Shammy#6484 for sharing his Sourcing_Guide with me when I needed one.

I reviewed the "generated_bom" tab, "Voron Afterburner Parts" tab, and the "Voron Optional Parts" tab in @shammy#6484's Sourcing Guide to see if any changes needed to be made.  @Shammy#6484 had a tab labeled "Voron 2.4 350" where he listed his cost per part and the quanity he purchased for his Voron 2.4 300mm³ build.

My build is 250mm³. So the changes you will see are due to the size difference.  I erased all his cost information and edited the items listed to buy.  I erased all his URL links so that I could enter my URL links.  I do not list the cost information. You can do that if you want.  My Sourcing Guide is not for me to total my cost, it is basically a way to let you know where I purchased most of my parts for the Voron 2.4 build.

Once my cost hit over $2,000 I quite keeping track of them.

The QUEEN Sourcing Guide is contained in a file called "QUEEN_Sourcing_BOM.xlsx" which is inside a .zip file called "QUEEN_Sourcing_BOM.xlsx.zip".  This makes it easier to download the Excel spreadsheet from GitHub since it is contained within a .zip file.

If I find anything missing after I publish this QUEEN Sourcing Guide, I will update it.

I hope this helps others who are in the middle of sourcing their Voron 2.4.
