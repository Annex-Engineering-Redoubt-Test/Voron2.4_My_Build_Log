## This is a Build Log Repository for my Voron 2.4 250 mm DIY 3D Printer called "QUEEN":

This repository contains wiring diagrams, specification sheets, any documentation I use to complete my Voron 2.4 build. Designs for the back panel or designs that have aesthetic value.

My Voron 2.4 3D Printer has a name "QUEEN".

## Mother board I plan on using:

I will be using the Octopus Pro V1.0 board as the mother board for my Voron 2.4 printer.
I will be powering my TMC5160 PRO stepper motor drivers with 48V DC.

## Planning Phase:

This is a work in progress.  I am still planning my Voron 2.4 build.

I have all my PIF parts and sourced all my parts via "sub-kits".  This will be explained later.

I want to post an Excel spreadsheet for where I bought all my "sub-kits" or individual items for my Voron 2.4 build, but I need to remove it from a bigger spreadsheet I have been using to keep track of a lot of different information.  After I get done with the electronics case wiring diagram I will work on providing an Excel spreadsheet for sourcing parts for my Voron 2.4 build.

## MODS I plan for QUEEN:

For now these are the MODS I plan on trying out:

## How I calculated the power requirements for my QUEEN build:

I know a lot of you already know the answer but for the rest of us that are still learning about bipolar stepper motors and stepper drivers. I want to share what I have learned today.  I never realized that the motors I own are bipolar-series motors.

To me when things are connected in series the wires are daisy-chained together (positive lead1, negative lead1 is connected to positive lead2, negative lead2).

When things are wired in parallel then the positive leads are connected together and the negative leads are connected together.

So I thought the 3D printer motors where connected together in parallel on the 3D printer, which they are. If you look at the system in a "macro" view not a "micro" view.

My problem was not understanding the term "series" and "parallel" when it applies to the internal wiring of the 4 wire bipolar motor (a "micro" view).

I had to look at 8 wire bipolar motors before I actually go it through my thick head.

Maybe this will help others:

[Drawing of 8 wire bipolar-parallel motor](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1KDEC_enUS925US925&sxsrf=AOaemvLwrmaDl8ua4lQseCKg1z3Zyqv7hA:1632969577225&source=univ&tbm=isch&q=stepper+driver+schematic+with+bipolar+parallel&fir=4TCFBxk3bBwQHM%252CPz8Y0vCOJhjweM%252C_%253Bdc6Xcx5op01amM%252CPz8Y0vCOJhjweM%252C_%253BItQbyHd9IexujM%252CdmTk8dQZiaTOKM%252C_%253BJq7NH4XUzw-gaM%252CbmpTPUvcAgJ1iM%252C_%253BNUciJ8biUMyATM%252CdmTk8dQZiaTOKM%252C_%253Bek59VPLAp7FTaM%252CfLr7UhIdS3zfiM%252C_%253Bcr7a5jpp9XtmSM%252CzzUhUZJ6gFb9SM%252C_%253BcHqWrnFkQqbUFM%252CU6NS1Lt6QBz7EM%252C_%253BxAUcqizP6jkfWM%252C8vsQdXCGrpQ9nM%252C_%253BHgNwYdr3N6uCPM%252CNKxfcF59LDIYkM%252C_&usg=AI4_-kR9_lmMfvjdB0rNsNvfnE_PhDKY6w&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi28NDc1aXzAhXFmmoFHevzDAUQ7Al6BAgCEEY&biw=1514&bih=650&dpr=1.25#imgrc=HgNwYdr3N6uCPM)

[Drawing of 8 wire bipolar-series motor](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbuildbotics.com%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2019%2F09%2F8wireSeries.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbuildbotics.com%2Fwiring-stepper-motors%2F&tbnid=c1vZXhJLkcsohM&vet=12ahUKEwinr7uN1aXzAhUGFKwKHYYtChEQMygJegUIARCzAg..i&docid=NKxfcF59LDIYkM&w=716&h=395&q=stepper%20driver%20schematic%20with%20bipolar%20motor%20series&ved=2ahUKEwinr7uN1aXzAhUGFKwKHYYtChEQMygJegUIARCzAg)

So ALL my motors are 4-wire bipolar-series motors!

 To Determine the amount of Power Required for your Voron 2.4 build:

 Fact: During a Z Hope move 6 motors will be active at a time.
 Fact:  Extruder (E) Motor LDO-42STH20-1004ASH:
		Rated Peak current: 1.0A/ Phase
 Fact:  Z motors and AB motors are LD0-42STH40-2004MAH
		Rated Peak current: 2.0A / Phase

 Rule of Thumb (https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/14071/how-to-calculate-my-power-supply-voltage-and-current):
 1. Power_supply_current = number_of_motors * 1/3 * motor_peak_current for "bipolar-series motors" (All LDO motors are bipolar-Series Motors!)
 2. Power_supply_current = number_of_motors * 2/3 * motor_peak_current for "bipolar-parallel motors"

 Since ALL LDO motors I own are bipolar-Series Motors we will use Rule of Thumb #1 ONLY!
 Power_ _supply_current = (5 * 1/3 * 2.0 Amps) + (1 * 1/3 * 1.0A) = 3.333 + 0.333 = 3.6667 or 4 Amps in series for 48V @ 4Amp = 192 Watts or 200 Watts PSU (if the PSU supplies the full power without an aluminum plate for heat dissipation).

Power my Voron 2.4 48VDC 250 mm Build (running all HT motors from LDO at 48VDC) with the following:
See Spec Data sheet : https://www.meanwellusa.com/upload/pdf/UHP-200(R)/UHP-200-spec.pdf

1. 48V PSU UHP-200-48 (AC to DC PSU)[(4.2A*0.8)= 3.36 Amps; I need 4 Amps! [not on aluminum plate so 80%]] : https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/UHP-200-48/7707242
2. 24V PSU UHP-200-24 (AC to DC PSU)[(8.4A*0.8)= 6.72 Amps ; I want at least 9 Amps! [not on aluminum plate so 80%]]: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/UHP-200-24/7707239

3. 48V PSU UHP-350R-48 (AC to DC PSU)[(7.3A*0.70)= 5.32 Amps; I need 4 Amps [not on aluminum plate so 70%]] : https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/mean-well-usa-inc/UHP-200-48/7707242; https://www.newark.com/mean-well/uhp-350r-48/power-supply-ac-dc-48v-7-3a/dp/01AH8032?ost=uhp-350r-48
4. 24 PSU UHP-350R-24 [(14.6A*0.70)= 10.22 Amps; I want at least 9 Amps [not on aluminum plate so 70%]]: https://www.newark.com/mean-well/uhp-350r-24/power-supply-ac-dc-24v-14-6a/dp/01AH8029?ost=uhp-350r-24

5. 48V PSU UHP-500-48 (AC to DC PSU)[(10.45*0.7)= 7.315 Amps; I need 4 Amps [not on aluminum plate so 70%]] : https://www.newark.com/mean-well/uhp-500-48/power-supply-ac-dc-48v-10-45a/dp/01AH8038?ost=uhp-500-48
6. 24V PSU UHP-500-24 (AC to DC PSU)[(20.9*0.7) = 14.63 Amps; I want at least 9 Amps [not on aluminum plate so 70%]]: https://www.newark.com/mean-well/uhp-500-24/power-supply-ac-dc-24v-20-9a/dp/01AH8036?ost=uhp-500-24

So I could use option 3 & 4 OR 5 & 6.  Since I plan on LEDS and running a Raspberry Pi 4B with a solid state disk drive via USB 3.1 interface instead of using a Micro-SD card I want to have enough power to add extras to my Voron Build.

I opted to buy the following:

    A. UHP-500-48 for my 48VDC supply
    B. UHP-500-24 for my 24VDC supply
    C. RS-25-5 for my 5VDC supply
    D. UHP-200-12 for my 12VDC supply.

I will use the Octopus Pro to power the stepper motor drivers, heater cartridge, temperature sensors, limit switches, and generate signals on PINs to control stuff, but I do not plan on powering stuff off the Octopus Pro board that is considered optional equipment like LEDs, and endoscope or cameras.  Since my Raspberry Pi (running Klipper) is the brains of this setup, I will be using a solid state drive to act as the disk drive for the Raspberry Pi.  This adds additional current draw and the Raspberry Pi will have its own 5V PSU.

All my LEDS are 12VDC or 24VDC. So that is why I am running a separate 12VDC PSU and added additional current capability to my 24VDC supply.

I plan on running all TMC5160 (HV) PRO stepper motor drivers for all my motors on QUEEN.
I know this is an overkill but if I want the power it will be there. I am lazy, and I do not want to redo wiring at a later date.

I am hoping I can fit all of this in my electronics case for a 250 mm build.  But the UHP power supplies are 1/2 the width of LRS-series PSUs.  I can fit the UHP-500-48 and UHP-500-24 in the same footprint as the LRS-200-24 PSU that is specified in the BOM.

## "Electronics_Case_Wiring_Diagram" directory you will find the wiring diagram for the electronics case for QUEEN:

This is the electronics wiring diagram I developed for my Voron 2.4 build:

Coming Soon.

## How to determine how your Motors will perform on a Voron Build:

You need to look at the torque curve for your motors and see how your motors perform at different voltages.

Here is an Excel spreadsheet that can help you: https://github.com/eddietheengineer/documentation/tree/master/stepper_motor/data

To download spreadsheet the file click on the file named ["motor_torque_sim_v7_database.xlsm"](https://github.com/eddietheengineer/documentation/blob/master/stepper_motor/data/motor_torque_sim_v7_database.xlsm) and hit the download button.

Once the Excel spreadsheet "motor_torque_sim_v7_database.xlsm" has downloaded, open it up in Excel but remember to "Enable" editing. If you do not enable editing you will not be able to see the "torque curve" graph. Also, the motors that are graphed can be chosen from a dropdown list. The voltage you run the stepper motors at can also be entered as can the current level.

Here are examples Torque Curves produced by the Excel Spreadsheet:

As you will see when you go from 24V to 48V you can move faster. Also notice that when you go from 48V to 60V the gain is smaller than the jump from 24V to 48V!

Here is the Torque Curve for the specified stepper motors at 24 VDC:

![Motor Torque Curve for 24V](images/Motor_Torque_Curve_for_24V.jpg)

Here is the Torque Curve for the same specified stepper motors at 48 VDC:

![Motor Torque Curve for 48V](images/Motor_Torque_Curve_for_48V.jpg)

Here is the Torque Curve for the same specified stepper motors at 60 VDC:

![Motor Torque Curve for 60V](images/Motor_Torque_Curve_for_60V.jpg)


As you can see when you go from 24V to 48V you can move faster. Also notice that when you go from 48V to 60V the gain is smaller than the jump from 24V to 48V!

## The Original BIGTREETECH Wiring Diagram for the Octopus Pro V1.0:

![Original Wiring Diagram](images/BIGTREETECH-Octopus-Pro-V1.0-Original-Wiring-Diagram.jpg)

## BIGTREETECH has a GitHub repository for the Octopus Pro V1.0:

The BIGTREETECH GitHub repository for Octopus Pro is located at https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-Pro

## BIGTREETECH has a GitHub repository for the Octopus V1.0/1.1 Board:

The BIGTREETECH GitHub repository for Octopus 1.0/1.1 is located at https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0

This repository also has information on how to wire up an Octopus V1.0/V1.1 board for a Voron Build and is located at https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0/tree/master/Octopus%20works%20on%20Voron%20v2.4/Firmware

## Klipper firmware supports the Octopus Pro V1.0 board:

Here is the link to the config file on GitHub for the Octopus pro V1.0 board https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/config/generic-bigtreetech-octopus.cfg.

If you are using the "PROBE" connector for a proximity sensor you will need to add a [probe] section to the "generic-bigtreetech-octopus.cfg" file and ensure that the sensor_pin: PC5

There is only two PINs that are different between the Octopus V1.1 pin-out and the Octopus Pro V1.0 pin-out. The Octopus V1.1 pin-out has PC5 on the EXP2 connector but on the Octopus Pro V1.0 this pin on the EXP2 connector is now "Not Connected (NC)".

The second PIN difference is that on the Octopus V1.1 pin-out PB7 is the signal PIN used on the PROBE/SENSOR connector and on the BLTouch header but on the Octopus Pro V1.0 the signal pin on the PROBE connector is PC5.  Which means that on the Octopus V1.1 board you can only use either a BLTouch or a Proximity Sensor but NOT both. On the Octopus Pro V1.0 since the signal pins for the PROBE connector is different from the BLTouch, if you wanted to, you could use both ports.

If you plan to use a voltage higher than 24V on MOTOR_POWER_IN then please pay attention to the following footnotes on the "Color PIN Diagram": 1.

You may need to change the Fuse on the MB_POWER_IN, calculate the maximum amps you will be using (3.(the four heaters {HE0-HE3}, 3.3V rail, 5V rail, and 12V rail all come off the 24V rail).  The maximum amps for 3.3 V rail is 1 Amp. The maximum amps for the 5V rail is 8 Amps. The maximum amps for 12 VDC rail is 4 Amps. So the total maximum amps for 3.3 VDC rail + 5 VDC rail + 12 VDC rail is equal to 13 Amps, but the amps needed to run the four heaters needs to be added to this value. Since BIGTREETECH supplies us with a 20 Amp fuse, then BIGTREETECH is saying that you have 7 more Amps available for the four heater ports or 1.75 Amps / heater cartridge.

Please use the "Color PIN Diagram" in [BTT_Octopus_Pro_V1.0_Color_PIN_Diagram](https://github.com/GadgetAngel/BTT_Octopus_Color_PIN_Diagram/tree/main/BTT_Octopus_Pro_V1.0_Color_PIN_Diagram) to obtain the correct PIN assignments.

If you decide to flash a new bootloader to the Octopus Pro V1.0 board (you should not need to because you can upload the new Klipper firmware using the micro-SD card reader) and find that the micro-SD card bootloader no longer works you will want to return the board to its shipment state by finding the original bootloader and "bootlaoder+firmware" files at https://github.com/GadgetAngel/BTT_SKR_13_14_14T_SD-DFU-Bootloader/tree/main/bootloader_bin/backed_up_original_bootloaders
