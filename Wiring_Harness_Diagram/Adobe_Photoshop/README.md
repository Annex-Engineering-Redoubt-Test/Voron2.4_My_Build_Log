# Wiring Harness for QUEEN (my Voron 2.4 build):

This repository contains Adobe Photoshop files for the wiring harness for QUEEN.

### The .psb files of the "Wiring Harness" for QUEEN:

There are two .psb files located here.  One is done in 900ppi and the other was produced from the 900ppi version, it is at 300ppi.

Since I do a lot of work in vector graphics, I have found that working in Photoshop at 900ppi makes it easier to convert stuff later to .svg files (if I use a higher ppi than 300).  Most photos are done at 300ppi.

Therefore, just out of habit, I work at 900ppi.  I up convert images to 900ppi using Photoshop.  When I want to produce an image I then down convert to 300ppi from 900ppi.

Since 900ppi produces very large files, I convert my original file down to 300ppi.  I tried uploading the 900ppi file to GitHub but GitHub, even with LFS installed, has an upper file limit of 2GB.

After converting my 5GB 900ppi file to 300ppi the file size was still 4GB. So I compressed each file using WinZip and got the file sizes below 2GB limit.

Use which ever file you want they are both the same.
